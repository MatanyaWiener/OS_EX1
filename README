WhatIDo Program Description:
First, the program creates two nested directories: welcome_dir_1/welcome_dir2, checks the position of the heap's break point
and changes it to a new value. Then, the program creates and opens a text file named
"./welcome_dir_1/welcome_dir_2/welcome_file.txt" and opens another file named etc/localtime.

The program then retrieves information about the etc/localtime file twice (It's size and its permissions), reads its full content,
moves the offset's position 1506 bytes backwards and reads again from that point to the end of the file. Then the program closes
the file.

Then the program retrieves information about /welcome_dir_1/welcome_dir_2/welcome_file.txt, and writes into it
"Welcome to OS-2023". The program closes the file, deletes it using the command unlink, attempts to delete the folder
/welcome_dir_1/welcome_dir_2/ using the same command, fails to do so, then deletes this folder with rmdir successfully.
Now the program attempts to to delete the folder /welcome_dir_1 using the same command, fails to do so, then deletes this folder
with rmdir successfully and exits the program.
